5. Write a program WindChill.py that takes two double command-line arguments t
and v and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Given the
temperature t (in Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the
National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) to be:

Note: the formula is not valid if t is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger
than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).
